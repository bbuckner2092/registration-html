Things to work on:
1.) Instead of using Br to separate each line use a <div> tag
2.) Make sure to incorporate the name attribute so when we send the request through the url it will id it as the specific name.
3.) For password length validation, make sure to always use the pattern and required title attributes.
4.) For <label> tags make sure to simply put the main title outside of the tag and then use a <select> tag for each category, Month, Day, and Year.
5.) For agreed portion, make sure to use a <label> tag for the I agree to terms folllowed by the <input> tag.
	Closing Remarks:
	I did complete it in its entirety but the syntax I used, <br> was not the correct one.  I needed to use the <div> tag.
